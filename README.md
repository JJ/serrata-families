# Venetian "Serrata" families and their status

Investigating why some families were coopted into the Serrata, after
Puga&Treffler and Raines, that is, why they were offered a seat in the Great
Council after the *closure* (Serrata) to families that had not participated
before.

This is a work in progress.
