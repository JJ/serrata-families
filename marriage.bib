abstract = {Two novel centrality indices, PathRank and Icentr, are defined. PathRank is a generalization of the PageRank algorithm, suitable to rank nodes of undirected graphs according to number and weight of paths in the graph. Icentr ranks the nodes of the graph by means of a combination of the weights of nodes and edges, scaled according to the distance from each node, one at a time. We apply the two novel indices to underground transportation networks, since these networks represent an infrastructural backbone for the transportation system of most big cities over the world. The characterization of the most important components of those networks and the simulation of their responses when they stop working properly, are vital for maintaining the mobility service at a desirable level. Since there are different ways to associate a graph to an underground network according to the degree of detail and aims of the study, we describe the methodology we adopted to associate a graph to such a network. The methodology was applied to 34 underground networks of worldwide cities, and the resulting graphs constitute the reference dataset. A detailed study of both Boston network and the dataset is proposed as prototypal for either a graph alone or all graphs in a dataset. Results show how different features of graphs are revealed by the two novel indices.}

  abstract={This article statistically analyzes quantitative data from numerous sources in order to assess changes in marriage patterns, family structure, and rates of social mobility during the period from 1282 to 1494. During this period, three systems of social stratification coexisted — wealth, political office, and age of family — but these contending status systems were not consistent in their rankings of families. Each status system was conservative in the sense that elite families at the top of that hierarchy married each other in order to stabilize their position. But because of inconsistency in rankings, contradiction within the elite opened up the Florentine marriage system to widespread upward social mobility by new men. In their own families, successful new men aggressively imitated their economically and politically declining status superiors. Sharp class divisions thereby blurred into continuous and negotiable status gradients. These open-elite patterns of social mobility, present throughout the early Florentine Renaissance, were most extreme during the Albizzi regime, immediately following the Ciompi Revolt.}

    abstract = {We analyze the centralization of political parties and elite networks that underlay the birth of the Renaissance state in Florence. Class revolt and fisical crisis were the ultimate causes of elite consolidation, but Medicean political control was produced by means of network disjunctures within the elite, which the Medici alone spanned. Cosimo de' Medici's multivocal identity as sphinx harnessed the power available in these network holes and resolved the contradiction between judge and boss inherent in all organizations. Methodologically, we argue that to understand state formation one must penetrate beneath the veneer of formal institutions, groups, and goals down to the relational substrata of peoples' actual lives. Ambiguity and heterogeneity, not planning and self- interest, are the raw materials of which powerful states and persons are constructed.},

However, this claim is mainly based on anecdotal evidence and limited case studies. In this paper, by relying on an original database of biographical and relational information on over 4,600 members, we carry out the first large-scale exploratory analysis of the network of interfamily marriages in ’Ndrangheta. Our analysis shows that this alliance network is polycentric, made up of cohesive subgroups centered around well-connected, powerful families, that occupy different positions in the network. The presence of patterns suggests that marriages in ’Ndrangheta are possibly the result of family strategies to explore and exploit their power and business. We discuss the implications of these findings for the study of marriages as an organizational instrument.}

    abstract = { This article critically assesses five areas that may together make the Irish organized crime milieu distinctive. First, there is minimal research. Second, organized crime groups and illicit enterprises are often characterized as “family-gangs.” Third, some violent conflicts are framed as family feuds. Fourth, a broad range of paramilitary groups have influenced Irish organized crime, in a variety of ways. Fifth, many organized crime groups and illicit enterprises are internationally mobile. Three types of mobility are identified: those commuting to other countries for one-off jobs, those migrating for longer periods, and mobile illicit enterprises. Allum’s push/pull model of criminal migration is employed to offer some suggestions as to why Irish criminals migrate and the choice of destination. The final section argues that some of the features that make Irish organized crime distinctive are changing or may have already changed. The article highlights key areas of further research needed to clarify the structure of organized crime in Ireland. }

Kin and affine networks, organized around the marriage institution, are shown to improve the individual's labor market outcomes, while at the same time increasing his social obligations, in Kisumu. Caste-based networks, also kept in place by the marriage institution, are shown to shape career choices in Bombay. Although the marriage institution may have demonstrated a significant degree of flexibility in transplanting traditional (rural) networks to the city, we argue that these networks will ultimately break down in the face of economic globalization.}

We then discuss how social connections affect the relationship between policy makers and the outside world, focusing on lobbying; the importance of family, caste, and ethnic networks; and social media and public activism. In our discussion, we highlight the key methodological challenges in this literature, how they have been addressed, and the prospects for future research.}

Using network analysis and a large prosopographic database, this article approaches this ques- tion from four perspectives: the marriage network of political elites, the backgrounds of chief ministers, the composition of the capital elite during three time slices, and the makeup of the provincial elite. Despite important continuities in the elite marriage net- work’s basic structure, there were also significant discontinuities. Between the seventh and eighth centuries, Luoyang emerged as a secondary political center, and Luoyang- based families—including so-called “marriage-ban” clans—acquired a renewed significance, partly at the expense of old southern clans, whose political significance declined over the course of the dynasty. In addition, the political divide between capital and provinces grew over time, culminating in the ninth century with capital-based men occupying nearly all significant provincial posts and provincials serving only locally and in second- tier offices.}

  abstract={Scholars and policy makers frequently advocate recruiting “embedded” bureaucrats with strong ties to citizens in order to improve service delivery. Yet, officials who are too embedded in their communities are often blamed for corruption, favoritism, and ineffectiveness. We argue that this ambiguity stems from a mismatch between individual- and communitylevel effects of embeddedness. While personal ties increase engagement between directly connected citizens and bureaucrats, a community-level increase in bureaucrats’ personal ties alienates unconnected citizens and undermines claims of impartiality. We test this argument on public safety provision in the Philippines. We measure family networks in 286 villages, locate police officers within those networks, and analyze citizen survey responses. Citizens are more willing to trust and engage with officers to whom they are more closely related. However, in villages where officers are highly embedded, unconnected citizens evaluate their performance more poorly. Consequently, village-level officer embeddedness is associated with higher rates of feuds and disputes.}

However, existing theory has been largely silent on the role of elite social networks, which interact with economic incentives and may facilitate antidemocratic collective action. We develop a model where coups generate rents for elites and show that the effort an elite puts into a coup is increasing in their network centrality. We empirically explore the model using an original dataset of Haitian elite networks that we linked to firm-level data. We show that central families were more likely to be accused of participating in the 1991 coup against the democratic Aristide government. We then find that the retail prices of staple goods that are imported by such elites differentially increase during subsequent periods of nondemocracy. Our results suggest that elite social structure is an important factor in democratic reversals.}

Consistent with our theory of political intermediation, we present evidence that family network centrality facilitates relationships of political exchange. Moreover, we show that family networks exercise an effect independent of wealth, historical elite status, or previous electoral success.}
